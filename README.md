# My-Weather-App

This is a weather app developed for apply all the main concepts about React.js library, such concepts like Components, Hooks, Context, Styled Components and React router. This was the first React project which I ever worked and I feel really proud of it.

It was made using create-react-app, also using the PWA template so I am really grateful with people who make this process easier. :P

In my opinion this is a really intuitive software, it does not require such a high level of coding to understand this code, and probably it has some "bad" practices which someone would expect of a Jr React Developer.

The interface it is also really simple, Whoever is reading this I would be really grateful if you recommend this project with some of your fellas.

Please feel free to send any comments to my personal email hola@josuecuevas.com

See you! ;)
